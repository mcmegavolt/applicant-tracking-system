 If you desire to test manualy, feel free to use my Postman collection:
 https://api.postman.com/collections/564701-3a250730-03ba-4aa1-bf34-f7f8847b7cf1?access_key=PMAT-01HY0CVT2YN4KAYXC5FVHYA3C9

 NOTE: Before using API, make a `POST login` request first and take a Bearer token from the response headers. Now you can use that token for the authentication of GET applications & jobs requests.
